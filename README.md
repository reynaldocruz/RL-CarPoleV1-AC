# RL-CarPoleV1-AC
I tested and trained the actor-critic method using Gym's Cartpole v1 environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in balancing the pole on the cart.
# Note
Please note that you will need to have Gym version 0.21 and TensorFlow version 2 installed in order to run this code. If you only wish to test the code without training, simply change the 'Train' variable to 'False'.
